Presentation
Problem: 
Redfin has agents, and we want to measure their efficiency in various ways.  We want to create a dashboard with agent stats by year and need your help 

a) designing a database that can store the necessary data and 
b) building a query to produce the output needed for the dashboard.  For each agent, by year, we want to measure:
 
	- How many customers agents get assigned
	- How many tours agents take customers on 
	- How many listing contracts agents sign with customers 
	- How many deals agents complete with customers selling homes
	- How many deals agents complete with customers buying homes
 
 
Background Information:
Here are some descriptions about the various real estate activities we want to gather stats for.  

	• When customers ask to contact an agent via the website, a specific agent gets assigned to the customer.  That agent works with the customer throughout the sales life cycle.  

	• When customers ask to go on a home tour via the website, a tour is scheduled with the agent and the customer and agent meet for the tour at an agreed upon date and time.  

	• When a homeowner wants to sell their home, they choose a real estate agent to help them list (sell) the home.  The listing real estate agent then signs a listing contract with the customer.  Real estate sales transactions are commonly referred to as deals.  

	• Typically, in a deal there is a seller represented by an agent, and a buyer represented by an agent. When a sales contract is signed by both the seller and buyer, the deal transaction is considered complete.  
 
 
Task:
 
1. Please outline the database objects you would create to help measure this.  You can draw a diagram, create the DDL or any other method you would like to  communicate what you would build.
 
2. Please write the SQL that we could use to generate a list of these stats by agent, by year.
 
3. Please give a 5 to 10 minute presentation to our team on what you built as part of this exercise.  You will give this presentation at the beginning of your onsite interview.  You can use any format you like to help communicate what you built.  We won’t ask questions during this presentation, it’s just a platform to showcase and explain what you did and why you did it.
